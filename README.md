# Combinatorial Hive Package

This folder contains a series of scripts and functions used to explore the Appleby-Whitehead construction for generating combinatorial hives of the type described by Knutson and Tao in their proof of the saturation conjecture.
For theoretical insight, see the work (in publication) here: https://doi.org/10.1080/10586458.2018.1473822. See also AWCompilationPrePrint.pdf for an open draft.

The code is largely self-documenting.

hiveExploration.m, hiveExplorationBatch.m, and hiveEnsembleAveragesFctn.m are user initiated calling functions for studying hives. boundaryChecking.m and manOptTest.m are test scripts used in the creation of this codebase. The other files are called internally.

The manopt folder is required to be included on the matlab active path.

This code is available for academic and personal usage and modification for any open project with appropriate attribution to the original author, John Lombard, through citation of the above paper. The work of other authors noted within (and
accompanied by their respective licences) is seperately handled.

This code may not be maintained regularly and does not guarantee correctness, but is provided in the interest of an open-science initiative and to provide a snapshot of current field research.
